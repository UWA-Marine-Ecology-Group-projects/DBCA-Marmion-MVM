<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Marine Values Mapper</p></h2>

## Invitation

You have been invited to use the Marine Values Mapper as a member of Perth's northern coastal community or as a visitor to the coast between Trigg and Two Rocks.

## Aim

This Marine Values Mapper will be used to inform the review and proposed expansion of Marmion Marine Park, helping to ensure management arrangements reflect the community’s knowledge, support sustainable use and protect the values of the area.

## Participation

The Marine Values Mapper allows users to input three different types of information - how you use the area, your knowledge of the area, and the values you hold. You will be asked to select areas on maps to record details of your activities and uses of the area or on the knowledge you have. The final part of the survey collects information about how you value the area. The level of detail you are willing to provide will determine how long the survey takes, but on average most people take between 15 and 30 minutes. If you have a large amount of information to input (e.g., more than 10 activities or knowledge topics), or are in an area with poor or intermittent internet connection, please consider separating your information into broad categories and contributing it over multiple sessions. You will also be asked to provide your name and contact details so that members of the research team can contact you should they need to clarify anything about your responses. This is to help ensure that the information you report is accurately represented in marine park planning.

## Voluntary participation and withdrawal from the study

Participation is voluntary and you have complete control over the information that you would like to provide. You will be able to select which activities and values you would like to provide information for. You may also withdraw from the survey at any time.  If you withdraw from the survey prior to pressing the ‘submit’ button, your information will not be saved. 

## Your privacy

Your participation in this study and any information you provide will be treated in a confidential manner. Any data presented publicly,in workshops or in publications will not identify individuals or organisations. Your responses will be stored on password protected computers at DBCA.

## Possible benefits

The information you provide will be used in marine park planning workshops to help ensure the review process for Marmion Marine Park is as robust as possible,  taking into account community values and uses where possible. 



## Possible risks and how they will be managed

The responses you provide will be used by DBCA and local planners to help 
review and proposed expansion of Marmion Marine Park.  The aim is to use the information to minimise the impact of management arrangements on marine users, where possible. 

## Contacts

If you have questions about this survey or the review and proposed expansion of Marmion Marine Park in general please contact the Marmion marine planning team at marmion@dbca.wa.gov.au
